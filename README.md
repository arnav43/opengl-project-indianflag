This project renders the Indian national flag using OpenGL. It displays the three horizontal stripes (saffron, white, and green) and a simplified Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes in navy blue at the center.

## What I Did
- Created the flag's stripes using triangle primitives
- Drew the Ashoka Chakra with a filled circle (triangle fan) and 24 line spokes
- Used separate shaders for saffron, green, and navy blue colors
- Made it run in a window with GLFW and OpenGL

Single file for shaders so easy to run, enjoy!
